###Â List of tasks for the project to be completed

- **QA the existing features**
- Make server actions consistent as well as toasters thrown and error handling across the app

- [x] Add user ids into the backend system so it would populate data with a relevant user id (generated uuid or email)
- Make site responsive
- Make library search results persist when changing route
- **Don't display 'No books' when it's simply loading books (make use of loading state / timeout)**
- Add dates of last modified in the reviews
- Chatgpt integration for the author dialogue chat
- Improvement of existing features UI & UX
  - [x] Rating system using stars/icons
- Add popups before deleting objects for UX

Future:

- Add share option to share book collections or reviews? Needs fleshed out
- Add RTE in reviews?
- Count of reviews/read books in the profile app

Bugs:

- Reviews need to be deleted dynamically - without user refreshing screen
- change user sid to email/sub as sid is likely to be session id which changes. We need conssitent id.
